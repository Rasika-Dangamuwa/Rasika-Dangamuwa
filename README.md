## 🚧 I Don’t Just Code — I Build Systems That Scale

I'm not here for just side-projects or tutorials.

🔧 **Key Focus Areas:**
- 🧩 Full-Stack Development (PHP, JavaScript, MySQL)
- 📱 Mobile-Responsive System Design
- 🧠 Role-Based Access Control & Workflow Automation
- ⚙️ GitHub-Powered CI / Project Collaboration
